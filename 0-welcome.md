## About Rubber Ducks

Rubber Ducks is a networking, social, & educational group centered around female-identifying and non-binary adults in STEM.

Our group was founded in 2017 with a mission to create a space for those that have traditionally been underrepresented in STEM roles (science, technology, engineering, and math).

Our name comes from the concept of "rubber duck debugging" in computer programming, where you talk aloud to a rubber duck to help solve the problem at hand. And that's what we do for each other!
