# VS Code

- Editor of choice

## `control + [backtick]`

- Opens terminal within editor interface
- You can have multiple terminal windows side-by-side in VSCode

## `command + /`

- Comments out current line
- Regardless of language

## `control + space bar`

- See all object properties available
- Especially helpful when using plugins or imported libraries

## `TODO: [your initials]`

- Syntax highlighting, depending on your VSCode theme
- I often write `TODO: ESA -` notes as I'm debugging
- Helpful to orient yourself or find where you left off, distinguish from other's TODO notes
- Do a search in the repo before submitting PR to clean up
